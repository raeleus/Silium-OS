	"email/love_letter.email": "I love you Stephanie! I will miss you now and forever. I will always remember that kinky touch of your claws, your lengthy stalks. If I close my eyes, I can still smell the stench of your pheromones. Please take me back baby!",
	"email/you_are_fired.email": "By order of his majesty, the great Monster King and master of all, I hereby release you of all of your duties and ranks. It pains me to inform you that you have been reassigned to guard duty for her highness, the Hive Queen. May you have better luck in your future endeavors.",
	"email/hitman.email": "Operation successful. Transfer payment to my account. Lack of payment will result in... consequences. Your predecessor did not understand this concept. He met a very untimely demise, as you might know.\nFurthermore, I look forward to our continuing relationship. I have been in touch with your \"old pals\" from the unit. Let's just say that their time is running thin as of late. Toodles!",
	"email/bread_recipe.email": "I usually start with 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, buddy. 1 teaspoon of salt does the trick. 3 cups of flower... look, if you want me to just come over and bake it for you, just let me know. I have a dutch oven and everything. You just need to provide the incidentals. And don't get that cheap store brand crap either. You can taste it in the crumb man. NO GOOD.",
	"email/distrust.email": "Yes, I've been having dark thoughts. It's true. The voices are becoming more pervasive and deafening. It really feels like the walls are closing in on me. Please help! For the love of the Monster King, I need salvation!",
	"email/emoluments.email": "So what? This is your chance to take advantage of your position, commander. I know plenty of cyborgs that would kill their bretheren to have the same chance that you are squandering right now. Take the extra ration. No one will blame you. It's expected actually. It's not like they compensate you for the extra responsibility, the extra time. I've got your back.",
	"email/dawn_of_the_dread.email": "Man, dawn of the dread is a great film. Please take me to see it again!",
	"email/programming_tutoring.email": "Yeah, most of the hivelings have no interest in actually learning the subject. Just do your best to not do their homework for them. They'll try to convince you that it's okay. \"Aww come on, it's just one lousy test question\" and before you know it you're reassigned to tree duty. Don't be that poor chap. That was almost my life.",
	"email/game_libraries.email": "They're telling me this libGDX is really powerful, like it's the best ever? I dunno, I don't like coding and hasn't that library been abandoned or something? I just want to drag and drop my game into existence. No, better yet, make my game for me. I'll pay you back in \"exposure\"",
	"email/friends.email": "I don't have any friends.",
	"email/re-distrust.email": "I told you before and I told you again: I don't give a hoot about your problems. Take it up with the hive queen. I'm sure she'd love to hear your complaints too.",
	"email/the_moon.email": "Does the moon look bigger to you? I'm not really sure myself, but I sware it just increased in size by a third. It dominates the sky at night now. Like some sort of sentinel, watching over us constantly.",
	"email/pyramid_corporation.email": "Hey, this is not spam. Look this is an opportunity of a life time. Buy my product and resale at double the cost! It's that simple: buy low and sell high. And there is no money up front! You just make sure that you pay a teeny, tiny percentage back up the chain. That's how you make the real money. Remember, just because it's shaped like a pyramid, it doesn't mean it's a pyramid scheme.",

	"email/the_hive.email": "The hive is breaking down man. I don't know about you, but I'm bugging out of here. Politics have really ruined things for us down here.",
	"email/long_may_he_reign.email": "The Monster King does not demand your obedience. You give it willingly. For his way has granted us culture, peace, prosperity, and major technological advancement. But a new threat has emerged: the occult. This alternative life style shall set us back a millennia if left unchecked. Inform on your friends, family, and neighbors. Actionable intelligence will be handsomely rewarded.",
	"email/the_timelines.email": "It's all a conspiracy my friend. They want us to believe that we just stood there and took it. Humanity just gave up as the Monster King's forces swelled and destroyed all in their path. It's not true though. I remember. I remember the path not chosen. Humanity won! I saw the villains driven into their holes and the inferno that soon followed them. They just don't want you to remember that. Ask yourself, is this really reality?",
